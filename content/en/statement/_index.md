# Statement

My artistic practice begins with my body as a living archive, where ancestral memory beats, historical cracks, and spiritual forces survive and live, facing the world from an artistic-political action. Through dance, performance, and multidisciplinary experimentation, I assume the body not as representation, but as invocation: a means of resistance, healing, and collective construction.

Through community work, I seek to situate Black and transvestite experiences as axes of creation and reflection. That is why my artistic and creative vision is articulated around spirituality, ritual, and embodied memory, recognizing that each gesture, each movement, is a power of political and transformative action.

I believe in the possibility of art as a space to confront the present reality and, at the same time, to imagine and conjure other already existing futures.
