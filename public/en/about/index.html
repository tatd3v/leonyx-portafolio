<p>Le&rsquo;Onyx Da&rsquo;Vida (Bogotá, Colombia) is a multidisciplinary artist, educator, and researcher whose practice focuses on the intersection between art, pedagogy, and activism. Their work weaves together performance, contemporary dance, audiovisual creation, and community-based art, exploring the body as a living archive and as a territory of resistance against racism, coloniality, and gender-based violence.</p>
<p>They hold a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Art Education from Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas and are currently completing the Professional Program in Dance and Choreographic Direction at Corporación CENDA. Le&rsquo;Onyx has also been a fellow of the Martin Luther King Jr. Leadership Program organized by the U.S. Embassy in alliance with the Centro Colombo Americano, and has participated in academic processes such as the First Seminar on Afro-Brazilian and Afro-Colombian Studies in collaboration with the Brazilian Embassy.</p>
<p>As the founder of the movement AfroNtando, Le&rsquo;Onyx has developed and directed processes that integrate artistic creation and community engagement, fostering dialogues with Afro-descendant communities and gender-diverse identities in Colombia. Their work has been recognized with awards and grants such as Art Against Intersectional Discrimination and Transformative Memories for Peace.</p>
<h2 id="artistic-statement">Artistic Statement</h2>
<p>My artistic practice begins with the body as a living archive — a site where ancestral memories, historical wounds, and spiritual forces endure and speak through movement. I approach the body not as representation but as invocation: a medium of resistance, healing, and collective construction.</p>
<p>Through community-based work, I seek to center Black and travesti experiences as sources of creation and reflection. My artistic vision is grounded in spirituality, ritual, and embodied memory, understanding that every gesture and every movement holds political and transformative potential.</p>
<p>I believe in art as a space to confront the present reality while simultaneously imagining and summoning other futures that already exist within us.</p>
